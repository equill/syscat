# Syscat - the System Catalogue

A network configuration database that actually covers everything, from hardware assets up to application interdependencies.
The REST API will be its only interface; anything else will be built on that. Thus, it lends itself to being driven by scripts and by other systems.

Based on [Restagraph](https://github.com/equill/restagraph).
